        <h3> presention</h3>
        <p id="p2">
            A presentation held by the Trauma Resource Institute prepared the community on how to process
            trauma through different exercises and guided conversations Saturday morning at the Child
            and Family Center.
            The presentation was presented by TRI, a nonprofit based in Claremont that works worldwide to bring the
            Community Resiliency Model (CRM) to others facing the aftermath of tragedy.

            In light of the Saugus High School shooting that occurred on Nov. 14., this presentation was created.
            TRI wanted to provide resources in the community to process their own trauma, without having to share
            their stories with the help of CRM.
